        <h1>freecodecamp journey</h1>
    </p>
    Freecodecamp for me as a beginner has really drained me but then it is a task i am to complete since it comes with great gains.After completion of a first challenge i was realy glad eventhough it was really tough.
    I felt motivated when i saw the certificates i could earn,how well i could be trained and how pressurising our lecturer was on us.With all  the frustrating errors and struggles i still make it through.But all the same,i have been able to grow in it .My coding skills have really improved through the course.
